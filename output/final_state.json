It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s structured to support a real-world logistics flow:\n\n1. **Products are stocked in warehouses.**\n2. **Customers place orders.**\n3. Orders get fulfilled from inventory \u00e2\u2020\u2019 shipments go out.\n4. **Suppliers send goods** via purchase orders \u00e2\u2020\u2019 stock gets restocked.\n5.
